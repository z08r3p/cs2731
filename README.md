java c1. Introduction to Recursive Calls in C Language
In C, recursion refers to the process where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller 
instances of a problem. A recursive function typically has two main components:
1. Base case: The condition that stops the recursion to prevent infinite calls.
2. Recursive case: The part where the function calls itself with modified 
parameters.
A common example of recursion is the calculation of factorials or Fibonacci numbers.
Here's a basic example of a recursive function in C:
In this example:
• The base case is when n == 0 or n == 1, where the recursion stops.
• The recursive case is when the function calls itself with n - 1.
Quiz: Understanding Recursive Calls
Here代 写data、C++
代做程序编程语言 are two quizzes to test your understanding of how a recursive function works. 
Below are C program that contains a recursive function. Predict the output for n = 3.
2. Write a program to create a single linked list with four nodes. Each node represents a 
user containing the name and the age of this user.
Example: 
Input: 
Output:
3. Fill in the blanks or complete the following program to make it work as 
described.
Output:
 Length of str1: 6
 Concatenated string (str1 + str2): APSIPA ASC 2024
 Comparison result (strcmp(str1, str4)): -1 (since "APSIPA" is lexicographically 
smaller than "apsipa")
 Converted integer + 10: 52
 Copied string into str1: ASC 2024
